      <h2>Modern Software Engineering</h2>

      <p>There is much the data practitioner can gain from study of Software Engineering, especially as it
      is presented in this book. <br>
      <br>
      The two central requirements of effective Software Engineering are extremely practical for anyone working with data:<br>
      - to become <em> expert at learning </em> <br>
      - to become <em> expert at managing complexity </em> <br>
      <br>
      I picked up this book after finding Dave Farley on YouTube. The content is tight, compelling, and manges to be suitably theoretical as well as practical.
