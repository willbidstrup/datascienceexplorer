      <h2>Modern Software Engineering</h2>

      <p> I picked up this book after finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfqyGl3nq_V0bo64CjZh8g">Dave Farley on YouTube</a>.
        The content in the book is tight and compelling, and I was excited to take notes and create this mind-map as a reference:

<strong>Applying the lessons to a data platform context</strong> <br>
In the last section of the book, Dave goes through the example of an ML process,
 and describes how his principles can be applied. I agree that the principles
 are generic and flexible across any software, which is one reason why this book is great.<br>
In this short article, I will muse on how the principles can be made relevant in the context of data platform engineering and operations. <br>
A data platform is surely a piece of software, and so of course all of the content applies in some way.
However, I think there are enough differences between a data ecosystem and a pure 'software solution' to warrant some
specific discussion about how to practically bring things to life.<br>
The first thing to call out is the huge dependancy on human actors in most/all data platforms. <br>
- Where is the boundary between software and human process?
