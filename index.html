      <h2>Modern Software Engineering</h2>

      <p>There is much the data practitioner can gain from study of Software Engineering, especially as it
      is presented in this book. <br>
      <br>
      The two central requirements of effective Software Engineering are extremely practical for anyone working with data:<br>
      - to become <em> expert at learning </em> <br>
      - to become <em> expert at managing complexity </em> <br>
      <br>
      I picked up this book after finding Dave Farley on YouTube. The content is tight, compelling, and manges to be suitably theoretical as well as practical.

    <h2> Setting up a Twitter Analytics Pipeline </h2>
    <p>

    <strong>Objective:</strong>set up a pipeline to store Twitter information in an incremental way for analysis. <br>
    <strong>Problem statements:</strong>

        <li>A search of the 'full archive' is not possible without an academic access level. </li>
      </ul>
    <strong>Approach:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up a developer account to gain access to the Twitter API. </li>
      <li>Create data pipeline from Twitter to Azure. </li>
      <li>Create dynamic file names and archiving strategy. </li>
    </ol>
